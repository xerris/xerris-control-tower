# xerris-control-tower

Xerris has put together the series of steps required to deploy the control tower in AWS.
There are multiple moving parts while the deployment hence we cannot automate the entire deployment process.
We are also in the process of automating / creating smallers modules where applicable.

There are 2 main steps when you are in process to deploy the control tower

1. To deploy the core control tower (foundation) alongwith the security controls (This document will help to achieve this)
2. To create accounts in the control tower accross environments (This is automated, follow https://github.com/xerris/xerris-terraform-control-tower-aft)
